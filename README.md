# CISC-Lab-1
For this project I made a countryside scene with two barns and some farm animals (chickens and a cow). 
One question that came up for me is how to consolidate/organize the various files that are associated with this project. I feel that the folder on my desktop and additionally my repository looks very chaotic because of the numerous different files that are shown. I could not figure out if having this many is a user error or if the project required this many files to be present in my folder and repository.
